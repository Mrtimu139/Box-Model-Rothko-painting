# About
This project recreates a minimalist representation of a Mark Rothko-inspired painting using HTML and CSS. The painting consists of three abstract rectangular shapes with layered effects such as blur, rotation, shadows, and color variations. The design is enclosed in a frame that gives the illusion of a real painting mounted on a wall. The project demonstrates creative use of CSS properties like box-shadow, transform, and filter to achieve a modern art effect.
